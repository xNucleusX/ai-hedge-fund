# v2 — AI Hedge Fund core

> **Status: Work in progress.** A ground-up rebuild of the engine, developed

v2 rebuilds the fund as a persistent, point-in-time-honest system, mirroring a
real shop's hierarchy:

```
FUND      =  capital slices over STRATEGIES   (master risk on the netted book)
STRATEGY  =  a blend policy over MODELS       (a "pod")
MODEL     =  an alpha model → a Signal        (conviction in [-1,+1] + thesis)
```

A fund is the **desk**, not a watchlist: the mandate names no tickers. Which
names to trade is supplied per run (`--tickers`, or the app's ticker prompt)
and recorded on every `CycleRecord` — so one fund can be pointed at anything,
and every run remembers what it traded.

A fund runs two kinds of pods, like a real shop. **Discretionary** strategies
are staffed by **agents** — LLM investor personas (Warren Buffett, Charlie
Munger, Benjamin Graham, Peter Lynch, Stanley Druckenmiller) whose judgment
is the edge; blend them long-biased or market-neutral. **Systematic**
strategies are powered by quant models (post-earnings drift) — the model *is*
the strategy, no persona attached. Both kinds implement one interface and
plug into the same engine unchanged.

Run a fund two ways: **one cycle** (today's data → today's target book) or a
**backtest** — the same cycle looped over history at the mandate's rebalance
cadence, producing an equity curve against your benchmark and a full
`CycleRecord` for every tick. Same code path, so a backtest is honest by
construction: it's the fund, replayed, not a separate simulator.

## Quickstart

```bash
poetry install                          # dependencies

# .env needs (at repo root):
#   FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=...      # market/fundamentals data
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...               # only for LLM agents (Buffett)

# THE command. No arguments: launch the interactive app (a Textual TUI).
# Build a fund — pick stocks, strategies, rebalance cadence — or backtest a
# saved fund and watch its equity curve draw against its benchmark.
poetry run aihf       # or, equivalently: python -m hedge_fund.tui

# With a mandate: run one cycle non-interactively (data → strategies →
# netting → risk → execution), full CycleRecord as JSON on stdout. A mandate
# carries no tickers — --tickers says what to point the fund at this run.
poetry run aihf ~/.hedge-fund/mandates/example.yaml --tickers AAPL,MSFT,NVDA

# Backtest a mandate: the same run_cycle looped over history at the
# mandate's rebalance cadence, full result JSON (every CycleRecord) on stdout.
poetry run aihf ~/.hedge-fund/mandates/example.yaml --tickers AAPL,MSFT --backtest

# Tests
poetry run pytest hedge_fund/
```

All API responses cache to disk (`~/.hedge-fund/cache/`), so reruns are fast,
free, and work offline once warmed.

## Architecture

```
Data (point-in-time) → Alpha models → Portfolio → Risk → Execution → Ledger
```

## Principles (non-negotiable)

- **Point-in-time by construction.** On any simulated date, only data actually
  filed by then is visible — the data layer filters on filing date, not report
  period. No lookahead, ever.
- **Fail loud.** Infrastructure failures raise; only genuine "no data" returns
  empty. A silent empty would poison a backtest as a fake "no signal."
- **The LLM never touches the trade.** Agents form *views* and *narrate*;
  deterministic code sizes and places orders; risk limits are hard gates.
- **One interface for every analyst.** Implement `AlphaModel.predict(ticker,
  date, data_client) -> Signal` and it plugs into the engine unchanged.

## Data contracts (`models.py`)

- `Signal` — an alpha model's output: `value` in `[-1, +1]`, plus `reasoning`,
  `components`, and `metadata`.
- `QuantSignals` — all signals for a ticker on a date.

## Contributing

Two high-leverage contributions:

- **A new agent or quant model** (code): read `signals/base.py` for the
  `AlphaModel` interface, use `signals/buffett.py` (an agent is just a system
  prompt) or `signals/pead.py` (quant) as a template, register it, add a test.
- **A new strategy** (no code): drop a YAML in `strategies/` bundling existing
  models with a blend policy — the fund builder picks it up automatically.

See [`../ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md) for the open list.
