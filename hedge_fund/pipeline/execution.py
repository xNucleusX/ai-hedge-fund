"""Execution — turn target weights into delta orders.

Targets are the complete statement of the desired book: any held name absent
from the targets has an implicit target of zero, so close orders fall out of
the same arithmetic as everything else. Pure function; the broker does the
filling.

Later: Almgren-Chriss optimal execution, market impact, fill probability.
