"""Alpha models — view-forming components of the quant stack.

See hedge_fund/signals/base.py for the AlphaModel / QuantModel interface.
Concrete models register here as they are implemented. Two flavors, one
interface: LLM investor agents (persona system prompts on LLMAgent) and
quant models (pure math).
