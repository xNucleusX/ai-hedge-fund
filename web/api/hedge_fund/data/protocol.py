"""Data provider protocol — the interface all data sources implement.

Any class with these methods can be used as a data provider throughout
the v2 pipeline. No inheritance required — Python's structural typing
handles the rest.

Example::

    class YFinanceClient:
        def get_prices(self, ticker, start_date, end_date, **kwargs):
            # fetch from yfinance, return list[Price]
            ...

    # Works anywhere the pipeline expects a DataClient
    client: DataClient = YFinanceClient()
