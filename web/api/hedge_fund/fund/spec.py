"""FundSpec — a fund's mandate as data, and the Fund that lives it.

The hierarchy mirrors a real shop (see VISION.md):

    FUND      = capital slices over STRATEGIES  (master risk on the netted book)
    STRATEGY  = a blend policy over MODELS      (a "pod")
    MODEL     = an alpha model -> Signal

Models come in two kinds, and the strategy's character follows from its
staff: a strategy of LLM investor AGENTS (Buffett, Munger, ...) is a
discretionary pod — its identity is who's on the desk; a strategy powered
by quant models (PEAD, ...) is a systematic pod — its identity is the edge
it harvests. Same spec shape, same engine slot; the kind is derived, never
declared.

Specs are data (a Loop-2 ground rule): a mandate is a serializable YAML/JSON
config. The wizard, a chat LLM, and the strategy generator all emit this same
format — nothing downstream ever needs to know who authored a fund.

A `Fund` is the living counterpart: the spec plus its models instantiated
once. Models are stateful (LLM prompt caches, PEAD earnings caches), so
they must be constructed per fund — never per cycle — for caches to survive
across cycles.
