"""run_cycle — one tick of the fund, the same code path in every mode.

    point-in-time data -> analysts -> blend -> risk -> execution -> record

This is the fund's heartbeat. A backtest is run_cycle in a loop over history
with a SimBroker; paper trading is the same loop on a live clock with a
PaperBroker; live is the same loop with a real broker. Only the clock and the
broker change — the pipeline never does.

run_cycle is the pipeline's only impure piece: it talks to the data client
and the broker. Every stage it delegates to (blend_signals, apply_limits,
build_orders) is a pure function. Determinism: given the same spec, date,
broker state, and data responses, the returned record is byte-identical —
with the one caveat that a cold LLM cache makes an agent's first live call
nondeterministic; the prompt cache makes every replay exact.

Notable behavior, chosen deliberately:
- Targets are the complete statement of the desired book. If every analyst
  abstains or goes neutral, the targets are all zero and the fund closes to
  flat. The record shows `abstained` on each signal, so an outer loop (the
  Day-5 daemon) can decide to skip a tick instead — that guard belongs
  outside the pipeline.
- A universe ticker with no price and no position is skipped (recorded, its
  analysts never called): unlisted/delisted names are normal in history.
  A HELD ticker with no price raises — a fund that cannot price its own
  book has an infrastructure problem, and its NAV would be a lie.
